1. Minimum RTO for a single AZ outage\
	- In case of single AZ outage, minimum RTO would be to get updated DNS changes. In case of Multi-AZ deployment, standby instance is already running and data is 		  replicated synchronously. This ensures quick recovery.\
\
2. Minimum RTO for a single region outage\
	- In this case, following factors will be considered:\
		i) Time to bring read replica as a standalone primary instance: This typically takes 15-20 minutes.\
		ii) Time to apply new DNS changes in application to connect to new end point. Depending upon application design this can take anywhere from 15-120 minutes. 		    If application is using centralized key/value management like Hashicorp Vault, change can be done only at one place.\
\
3. Minimum RPO for a single AZ outage\
	- In Multi-AZ scenario, automatic backups are enabled. It means AWS will take full snapshot once a day.\
	- Thus, minimum RPO for a single AZ is 5 minutes.\
\
4. Minimum RPO for a single region outage\
	- In Multi-AZ, Multi-region mode, database is updated asynchronously between Primary and read replica.\
	- During initial setup and installation time, it takes minimum 15-20 minutes for system to get ready.\
	- Thus, minimum RPO for single region outage is around 15 minutes.}
